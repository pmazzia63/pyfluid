# PyFluid ![PyFluid Simulation Example](_static/logo.png)


## Overview
PyFluid is a Python package designed for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. Developed with Python 3.10 and Cython, it aims to provide a flexible, efficient, and user-friendly platform for conducting CFD simulations in both academic and industrial research settings.

## Features
- **High Performance**: Leveraging Cython for computationally intensive tasks to ensure high performance.
- **Python 3.10 Integration**: Full compatibility with Python 3.10 features for seamless integration into modern Python environments.
- **User-Friendly API**: Intuitive and well-documented API to facilitate ease of use for both beginners and experienced users in the field of CFD.
- **Customizable Simulations**: Extensible framework allowing users to customize simulations according to their specific requirements.

## Installation
For now, the package isn't on pip yet so to use it :

```bash
pip install git@github.com:pmazzia63/pyfluid.git
```

And in the future :
